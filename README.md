PROJECT SADANG

# TODO

- [ ] Default exchange selected for the column named `price difference` is `korbit`.
- [ ] Dropdown menu should be applied to the price difference table column.
- [ ] Header should contain a button to change the currency. The default currency is BTC. 
- [ ] The price should show either KRW or USD. (it would be good to have a dropdown button on the table column so that user could change the fiat currency).
- [ ] Price column includes commas for the better readability.
- [ ] Dashboard Includes the refresh time.
- [ ] Let Dashboard update every `n` mins. (Default: `2min`).
